# Project Learnings

Lessons learned during development that should inform future work. Ralph reads this file before each iteration to avoid repeating mistakes and to apply proven patterns.

---

*This file will be populated as features are built. When you discover something that would help future development, add it under the appropriate category below.*

## Database / Prisma

<!-- Example:
- Always run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
- Use `@default(now())` for createdAt timestamps
-->

## API Routes

<!-- Example:
- Return proper status codes: 201 for created, 400 for validation errors
- Always validate request body with zod before processing
-->

## UI Components

<!-- Example:
- shadcn Dialog needs `onOpenChange` handler to control open state
- Use `getByRole` in tests for better accessibility coverage
-->

## Forms & Validation

<!-- Example:
- Keep forms mounted during async submission so toasts display
- Show field-level errors below inputs, not just in toast
-->

## Testing

<!-- Example:
- Playwright needs explicit waits for toast animations
- Mock date/time in tests that depend on timestamps
-->

## Performance

<!-- Example:
- Add `loading` state to buttons during async operations
- Use React Query for server state that needs caching
-->

## Other

<!-- Anything that doesn't fit above categories -->
