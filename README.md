# Prompt2Production Starter

A production-ready Next.js boilerplate optimised for AI-driven development using the [Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) iterative workflow.

## What is Prompt2Production?

**Prompt2Production** is a methodology for building production-quality software using AI coding assistants. It bridges the gap between "vibe coding" and professional engineering by combining:

- **Structured AI workflows** — Repeatable patterns that produce consistent, high-quality output
- **Proper engineering discipline** — Testing, validation, design systems, and documentation
- **Iterative development** — Let AI agents build features autonomously while you sleep

This starter template embodies these principles, giving you a foundation where AI assistants can work effectively within defined constraints.

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

Ralph is an iterative AI development technique created by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). At its core, it's simple:

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude; done
```

The AI agent picks up a task, implements it, tests it, commits — then picks up the next task. Repeat until done.

**Real-world results:**
- 6 repositories generated overnight at a Y Combinator hackathon
- $50k contract delivered for $297 in API costs
- Complete CRUD applications built in ~25 minutes

This starter is pre-configured for Ralph with `prd.json` (user stories), `progress.txt` (iteration log), and documentation that guides AI behaviour.

## What's Included

- **Next.js 15** — App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma** — Database with type-safe ORM
- **shadcn/ui** — Beautiful, accessible component library
- **Testing** — Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) configured
- **AI-Ready Documentation:**
  - `CLAUDE.md` — Project context for AI assistants
  - `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — UI/UX patterns for consistent output
  - `prd.json` — User story template for Ralph workflow
- **Docker** — PostgreSQL infrastructure compose file

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Rename

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prompt2production-starter.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Initialise shadcn/ui

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

When prompted, select:
- **Style:** Default
- **Base color:** Slate
- **CSS variables:** Yes

(Components are installed on-demand by the AI agent as needed)

### 4. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy example env
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database password
# Update values in both the variables AND the DATABASE_URL
```

### 5. Start Database

**Windows users:** Ensure Docker Desktop is running first.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml up -d
```

### 6. Run Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

### 7. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — you should see the starter page.

## Workflow: Trigger Words

The Prompt2Production workflow uses specific trigger phrases to guide Claude through each phase:

| Phase | Trigger | Required? | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **0. Project** | `Project:` | Yes | Sets context for your app |
| **1. Design** | `Design system:` | Yes | Creates UI components and styling |
| **2. Features** | `Plan features:` | Optional | Breaks project into feature roadmap |
| **3. Plan** | `Plan feature:` | Yes | Creates PRD and stories for one feature |
| **4. Build** | Ralph command | Yes | AI builds the feature autonomously |
| **5. Complete** | *(automatic)* | — | Ralph marks done and shows next feature |

### Example Flow

```bash
claude

# Step 1: Set project context
> Project: A recipe management app for home cooks to save and organise their favourite recipes.

# Step 2: Define the look and feel
> Design system: warm and inviting, orange/amber primary, cream backgrounds, top navigation.

# Step 3 (optional): Plan all features
> Plan features:

# Step 4: Plan a specific feature
> Plan feature: recipe-crud

# Step 5: Run Ralph (see below)
# When Ralph completes, it automatically outputs:
# "Next feature: recipe-categories - To continue, run: Plan feature: recipe-categories"

# Step 6: Continue with the next feature
> Plan feature: recipe-categories
```

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed instructions on each phase.

## Using with Ralph

### 1. Complete Setup Phases

Before running Ralph, complete the Project and Design phases (see workflow above). Then plan your feature:

```bash
claude
> "Plan feature: [describe what you want to build]"
```

Claude will create a feature folder with planning documents:

```
features/
└── your-feature/
    ├── PRD.md        # Requirements
    ├── prd.json      # User stories
    └── progress.txt  # For Ralph logs
```

### 2. Review Generated Files

Check `features/[your-feature]/` and adjust if needed.

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
# Start Claude Code in YOLO mode
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Install Ralph plugin (first time only)
/plugin install ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official

# Run the loop (replace [feature-name] with your folder name)
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "You are working on this project.

BEFORE EACH ITERATION:
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project context
2. Read DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for UI patterns
3. Read features/[feature-name]/prd.json and find the first story with passes: false

YOUR TASK:
1. Implement the story following all acceptance criteria
2. Run tests to verify (npm run test for unit, npx playwright test for e2e)
3. Fix any failures before proceeding

WHEN STORY COMPLETE:
1. Update features/[feature-name]/prd.json - set passes: true
2. Append to features/[feature-name]/progress.txt
3. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m 'feat([ID]): [title]'

WHEN ALL STORIES COMPLETE:
Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If stuck after 3 attempts, document blockers and move to next story." --max-iterations 25 --completion-promise COMPLETE
```

### 4. Monitor Progress

- Watch Claude Code output in real-time
- Check `features/[feature-name]/progress.txt` for iteration logs
- Use `/cancel-ralph` to stop if needed
